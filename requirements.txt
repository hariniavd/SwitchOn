Dependencies of the Project:

1. Python 3
2. PyQt5
3. MongoDb
4. QtChart
5. pandas


*** Python 3 ***
* The main advantage of Python 3 is that it is on the cutting edge, so all the new features will be implemented in
there rather than being added to Python 2.
* Python 3 is more consistent language.
* Python 3 is the present and future of the language.
* Latest version of Python 3 has been used in this project with latest technologies.

*** PyQt5: ***

* Qt is set of cross-platform C++ libraries that implement high-level APIs for accessing many aspects of modern desktop
and mobile systems. These include location and positioning services, multimedia, NFC and Bluetooth connectivity, a
Chromium based web browser, as well as traditional UI development.
* PyQt5 is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and
enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including
iOS and Android.
* PyQt5 may also be embedded in C++ based applications to allow users of those applications to configure or enhance the
 functionality of those applications.

Please use the below command to install PyQt5 binding:
- pip install PyQt5

*** MongoDb ***

* One single main benefit it has over MySQL is its ability to handle large unstructured data.
* It is magically faster. People are experiencing real world MongoDB performance mainly because it allows users to query
 in a different manner that is more sensitive to workload.

Please use the below command to install pymongo binding:
- pip install pymongo

*** QtChart ***

* PyQtChart is a set of Python bindings for The Qt Companyâ€™s Qt Charts library.
* The bindings sit on top of PyQt5 and are implemented as a single module.

Please use the below command to install pymongo binding:
- pip install PyQtChart

*** pandas ***
* Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool.
* It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame.
* DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.

Please use the below command to install pymongo binding:
- pip install pandas
